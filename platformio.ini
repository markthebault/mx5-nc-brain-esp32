; 1. LOWER CPU FREQUENCY FOR POWER SAVINGS
; The C6 can run at 80MHz or 160MHz. 
; Reducing to 80MHz lowers the base current draw significantly during active periods.

; 3. FIX MONITOR ISSUES
; Most ESP32-C6 DevKits use a built-in USB-to-Serial. 
; Setting DTR/RTS to 1 (not 0) is usually required to actually see output.

; 4. OPTIMIZE COMPILE TIME
